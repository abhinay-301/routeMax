Here is a **detailed requirements specification** for your project: a web-based tool to manage and visualize transportation **routes and stops** using **AG Grid** and **Trimble Maps**, built with React and modern tooling.

---

# üßæ Project Requirements Specification

---

## üìå 1. **Project Overview**

Build a **React web application** that allows users to:

* View, filter, and edit **transportation routes and stops**.
* Visualize the selected routes and stops on an interactive **Trimble map**.
* Perform **inline and bulk edits** to specific fields.
* Switch between **light and dark modes**.

The application should be responsive, performant, and user-friendly.

---

## üìö 2. **Core Features**

### a. **Routes Grid (AG Grid)**

* Display list of all available routes.
* Allow **multi-row selection** of routes.
* Fields to display:

  * Route Name (editable)
  * Status (Locked, Unlocked ‚Äî editable via radio buttons)
  * Route Type (City, Trap ‚Äî editable via dropdown)
* Support **inline editing** of individual fields.
* Support **bulk editing** of selected rows.
* On route selection, update:

  * Stops Grid to show stops of selected routes only.
  * Map to show selected routes and stops.

### b. **Stops Grid (AG Grid)**

* Display list of **stops** for currently selected routes.
* Allow selection of individual stop rows.
* Clicking a stop should **highlight that stop** on the map.
* Fields to display:

  * Stop Name
  * Coordinates (Lat, Lng)
  * Arrival Time (optional)
* No editing needed for stops in this version.

### c. **Map Integration (Trimble Maps)**

* Load an interactive map using Trimble Maps JavaScript SDK.
* Display:

  * Selected **routes** as lines.
  * Selected **stops** as pins or markers.
* On stop selection (from grid), **highlight stop** on map (e.g., bounce animation or color change).
* Zoom and center map automatically to include selected data.

### d. **Themes (Light / Dark Mode)**

* Toggle switch to switch between light and dark themes.
* Map, grids, and UI components should all update accordingly.
* Use Tailwind + Zustand to manage theme settings.

### e. **Editing Functionality**

#### ‚úÖ Inline Edit

* Fields:

  * **Route Name**: Free text input.
  * **Status**: Radio buttons.
  * **Route Type**: Dropdown (using `react-select`).

#### ‚úÖ Bulk Edit

* Support selecting multiple routes and updating fields for all at once.
* Show a bulk edit toolbar or modal when multiple routes are selected.

## üîß 3. **Tech Stack**

| Layer        | Technology                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Frontend** | React (TypeScript)         |
| **Grid UI**  | AG Grid                    |
| **Styling**  | TailwindCSS                |
| **State**    | Zustand                    |
| **Map**      | Trimble Maps SDK           |
| **Forms**    | React-select, Radio Inputs |

---

## üß† 4. **State Management (Zustand)**

State slices to include:

* `routes`: list of all routes.
* `selectedRouteIds`: IDs of selected routes.
* `stops`: stops filtered by selected routes.
* `selectedStopId`: stop currently selected.
* `theme`: light or dark.
* `editedRoutes`: temp buffer for edits (optional).

---

## üîÑ 5. **Data Flow Requirements**

* On app load: fetch all routes and stops (can use mock JSON or API).
* On route select: filter stops, update map.
* On stop select: highlight marker on map.
* On route/stops edit: reflect changes immediately in UI.

---

## üß™ 6. **Non-Functional Requirements**

| Requirement           | Details                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**       | Should handle 100s of routes/stops efficiently.   |
| **Responsiveness**    | Should work on desktops and tablets.              |
| **Accessibility**     | Keyboard-friendly navigation and proper contrast. |
| **Extensibility**     | Easy to plug in real APIs or backend.             |
| **Theme Persistence** | Store theme in localStorage or Zustand persist.   |

---

## üì¶ 7. **Optional Features for Later**

* Add ‚ÄúAdd Route‚Äù / ‚ÄúAdd Stop‚Äù functionality.
* Support saving changes to backend (API integration).
* Route clustering and grouping.
* Export to Excel or PDF.
